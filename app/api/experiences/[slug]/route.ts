      "In this project, I was responsible for developing a web-based Learning Management System (LMS) application intended for internal use by Sarimurni Group. The application was designed to support the employee training and development process in a digital and centralized manner, making it more efficient and accessible across the organization. I began by designing an intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly interface (UI) along with a seamless user experience (UX). The design was tailored to meet the needs of internal users while aligning with Sarimurni Groupâ€™s visual identity to ensure consistency and professionalism. My main focus was on building the CMS (Content Management System) interface, which would be used by administrators or specific users to manage training content, user data, and system settings. I ensured that the CMS interface was not only functional but also easy to navigate based on daily operational needs. During development, I also integrated the frontend with APIs provided by the backend team. This integration allowed data to be displayed and managed dynamically, ensuring smooth two-way communication between the user interface and the backend system. Additionally, I implemented a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism to maintain secure and structured access across the platform. This system ensures that each user can only access features and information relevant to their roles and responsibilities within the organization. Through this approach, I aimed to build a secure, efficient, and user-oriented platform to support internal learning processes.",
