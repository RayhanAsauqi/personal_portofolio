      "In this project, I was responsible for developing a web-based Learning Management System (LMS) for internal use by Sarimurni Group. The platform supports employee training and development in a centralized and digital way. I designed a responsive and intuitive UI/UX aligned with the companyâ€™s visual identity. My main focus was building the CMS interface that allows admins to manage content, users, and system settings efficiently. I also integrated the frontend with APIs provided by the backend team to ensure dynamic data handling. To maintain security, I implemented a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, ensuring users access features based on their roles and responsibilities.",
